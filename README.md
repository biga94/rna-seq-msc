# RNA-seq project for Transcriptomics part in our Molecular Biotechnology and Bioinformatics Master degree.

For the first part of this project we are asked to work on a human gene expression profiling RNA-Seq dataset composed by 36 samples from 6 tissues.

Of the \~ 56k human genes that are annotated in the GenCode annotation only 28266 high quality genes have been retained. For each sample we have the expression values (read counts) for:

-   18829 (high quality) proteing coding genes
-   9438 (high quality) non protein coding RNAs (6520 lincRNA, 1780 snRNAs and 1137 miRNAs)

Here are provided the .R script, the corresponding .Rmd and .html reports. Also, two Venn Diagram have been produced and integrated in the repository.
